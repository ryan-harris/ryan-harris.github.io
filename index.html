      <!-- About me text content-->
      <p>
        My name is Ryan Harris and I'm a professional software developer. I
        graduated from UCLA with a Bachelors in Computer Science and also have a
        certificate from UCSD in full stack development. During my
        time at UCLA, I trained primarily in C++ before accepting a Java
        developer role at Teradata. I worked as a Java developer for Teradata
        between 2012 and 2017. In 2017 I left the software development field
        to pursue other interests, but ultimately decided to return back to
        programming in 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        While at Teradata I worked on a product called Teradata Studio, which
        was a desktop application for database administration, SQL query
        development, data transfers, and management tasks for Teradata,
        Aster, and Hadoop databases. I developed a wide variety of features,
        including an enhanced SQL editor, a data transfer
        feature, file input and output for loading/exporting tables, wizards
        to assist users to create/modify database schemas, users, and other
        objects, and Hadoop connectivity. In addition to writing Java, I also
        managed the team's automated build and testing environments using
        Teamcity and Git. I led the effort to migrate our code base from
        Subversion to Git while preserving all the Subversion commit history.
        I also setup and managed Hadoop clusters for development and testing
        purposes.
